       "| **5:30 PM** | **Wind‑down start** | Stop intense work, turn off bright screens, dim lights. |\n",
       "| **6:00 PM** | **Light dinner** | Avoid heavy meals and caffeine. |\n",
       "| **7:00 PM** | **Relaxation activity** (reading, gentle stretch, meditation) | Signals body to slow down. |\n",
       "| **8:30 PM** | **Turn off all electronics** (phone, laptop, TV) | Blue‑light reduces melatonin. |\n",
       "| **8:45 PM** | **Bedroom prep** (dim lights, cool temperature ~18 °C, white‑noise if needed) | Creates a sleep‑friendly environment. |\n",

       "| **9:30 PM** | **Lights out** | Sleep‑on‑time. |\n",
       "| **6:00 AM** | **Wake‑up** | Use a gentle alarm or light‑based alarm clock. |\n",

       "## 1. Set a Consistent Sleep Schedule  \n",
       "- **Goal:** 7–9 h of sleep per night.  \n",
       "- **Tip:** Use an alarm clock that *gradually* wakes you (sunrise alarm) so you don’t jump out of bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Create a Pre‑Bed “Wind‑Down” Ritual  \n",
       "- **Why it matters:** The brain needs a clear cue that it’s time to slow down.  \n",
       "- **What to do:**  \n",
       "  - **Low‑light activities** (reading a paperback, knitting).  \n",
       "  - **Avoid screens** 30–60 min before bed.  \n",
       "  - **Gentle stretching** or yoga poses.  \n",

       "## 4. Watch What You Eat & Drink  \n",
       "- **Avoid caffeine** after 2 PM.  \n",

       "- **After one week**:  \n",
       "  - Check if you feel rested.  \n",

       "- **Track your mood.** Good sleep often correlates with better mood and productivity.  \n",
